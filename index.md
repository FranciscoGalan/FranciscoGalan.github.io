## Sample Tableau Dashboards

*My philosophy*: I use a subtle, subdued visual design, with little storytelling, to draw attention to where it's really needed.

Most importantly, I try to make it easy for users to answer actual business questions they might have.

I give priority to simple yet effective charts rather than inappropriate media or meaningless graph variety.

But if complexity or unusual layouts are called for, I find a way through.
